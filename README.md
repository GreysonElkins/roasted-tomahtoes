## Developer Set Up 

<!-- To interact with the app without cloning / downloading the file, click [here](https://leighlars.github.io/overlook-solo/). -->

1. Clone down this repo. Since you don't want to name your project "webpack-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
2. Remove the default remote: git remote rm origin (notice that git remote -v not gives you back nothing)
3. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of [what you want to name the repo] to be consistent with naming
4. Add this remote to your cloned down repo: git remote add origin [address you copied in the previous step] - do not include the brackets
5. Now try to commit something and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.
6. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
7. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to interact with the application. 
<!-- 8. To log in as , the username is 'manager'. To login as a customer, enter the username '', or any ending number up to 50. Both passwords are 'overlook2020'. -->
9. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
